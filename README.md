#### Essay Dashboard [pandoc]

This is yet another iteration of a web app I've written for myself to have an alternative space to plan and write essays. It's very tuned to my writing style, so isn't the most elegant or useful for anyone operating outside of my brain. That being said, I'm proud of it. It's been very useful in keeping all of my essay notes in one place and helping me get writing. Basically a fork with pandoc


#### Tools used
* Using Ruby 4.2.2, Rails 5.1.4

* Using [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) as the database

* Using [Redcarpet](https://github.com/vmg/redcarpet) gem for markdown parsing

* Using [Materialize](http://materializecss.com/about.html) gem for aesthetics, bells, and whistles. (Materialize is my favorite thing.)

<!-- * Currently deployed [here](http://www.laphelps.me) via [Heroku](https://heroku.com)! The functionality doesn't actually make sense for the internet, but I wanted to throw it up to show what I've been working on. -->
